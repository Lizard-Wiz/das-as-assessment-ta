    <h2> <a id="ourpurpose" name="ourpurpose"></a> 3. Our purpose </h2>
    <p dir="ltr">Sue Ryder supports people through the most difficult times of their lives. For over 65 years 
        our doctors, nurses and carers have given people the compassion and expert care they need to help 
        them live the best life they possibly can.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">We take the time to understand what’s important to people and give them choice and control 
        over their care. This might be providing care for someone at the end of their life, in our hospices 
        or at home. Or helping someone manage their grief when they’ve lost a loved one. Or providing 
        specialist care, rehabilitation or support to someone with a neurological condition.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">We want to provide more care for more people when it really matters. We see a future 
        where our palliative and neurological care reaches more communities; where we can help more people 
        begin to cope with bereavement; and where everyone can access the quality of care they deserve.</p>


    <h2> <a id="ourpromise" name="ourpromise"></a> 4. Our promise to you </h2>

        <li>Analyse geographic, demographic and other information relating to our supporters in order to better understand your background, interests and preferences  </li>
        <li>Decide appropriate requests for funds and identify supporters who may be able and willing to give more than they already do  </li>
        <li>Researching and collating information on both existing and potential supporters and partners to ensure that we are engaging with the people most likely to support the charity and asks for support at an appropriate level </li>
