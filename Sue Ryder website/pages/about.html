    <h2>Lady Sue Ryder</h2>
    <p><strong>Our founder, Lady Sue Ryder, was a humanitarian who was dedicated to the relief of suffering.</strong></p>
        
      <p>Her work started in WWII, helping people displaced from their homes as a result of war. After 
      the war she widened the scope of her work, supporting people in need of palliative and neurological 
      care across the UK and internationally.</p>

    <p> Her work was expansive and international, so when she died on 2nd November 2000 she left
      behind a legacy of charities around the world, including ours, who continue to provide care
      based on her principles: compassion and the relief of suffering.</p>

    <h2>Lady Sue Ryder's story: 1924-2000</h2>
    <p>What Sue Ryder saw and experienced during the war almost inevitably resulted in her
      committing the rest of her life to relieving suffering. She lived by a simple ethos:</p>

     </p>

     <h2>Setting up what we do now</h2>
      <p>It might be difficult to see how the work of Lady Ryder in the war ended up with her 
         starting the work we continue today: providing palliative, neurological and 
         bereavement support.</p>
        
         <p>But the reason is actually very simple; Sue Ryder was a humanitarian whose mission was the 
          relief of suffering. This universal purpose stood above any one particular cause. Where there 
          was a need, if she could help, she would. In the aftermath of war, there were many displaced 
          people in Europe and so she did whatever she could to care for them.</p>

          <p>The first Sue Ryder home in the UK opened in her mother’s house in Cavendish, Suffolk, 
            in 1952, and its first patients were survivors of the concentration camps. </p>

          <h2>Meeting new needs</h2>  
           <p>As the years since the war rolled by, the scope of Lady Ryder’s work widened to include 
            supporting people with palliative and neurological conditions across the UK and 
            internationally. It was the same principle: where there was a need, if she could help, 
            she would.</p>

            <p>As such, in 1974, the first home for cancer patients was opened. Word spread, and soon 
              Sue Ryder was being asked to provide similar homes in different parts of the country. 
              A meeting of cancer specialists from all over the country was called to identify areas of 
              need. Sue Ryder called them ‘SOS’ areas.</p>
              
              <p>Gloucestershire was one area of need and a ruined manor house near Cheltenham was 
                 acquired and rebuilt as Leckhampton Court Hospice. Nettlebed Hospice (now the South Oxfordshire 
                 Palliative Care Hub) was then established to serve the Reading area and so the pattern went on.</p>
              
              <p>As a result of her work, today we have seven hospices and four neurological care centres 
                continuing the work of Lady Ryder.</p>
